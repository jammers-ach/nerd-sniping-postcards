nerd-sniping-cards
==================

Nerd sniping was popularised in [xkcd #356](http://xkcd.com/356/).

I saw this, thought about the infinute resitor problem, gave up and read the solution.

I then thought "I have friends, they like postcards, they also like hard problems." so I loaded up inskape and made a card with this problem on it and sent it to my friend.

I also realised I have friends who aren't eletrical engineers, but are computer scientists, they would also *love* a postcard from me with a difficult problem on it. So why not send it to them?

Thus nerd-sniping-cards was born
