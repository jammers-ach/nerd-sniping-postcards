So why not send it to them?\r\n\r\nThus nerd-sniping-cards was born\r\n\r\n![First card](1.png)\r\n\r\n## How do I use them?\r\n\r\n1. First think of someone who has done you wrong.\r\n2. Download and print the files onto some nice 230gsm card. You can either print the PNG files or the SVG files from inkscape.\r\n3. Turn it over, put on the address and a stamp, and a little message, something like _Remember to show your working_\r\n4. Post it to them\r\n\r\nn.b. I'm from Britian and live in Russia. check the postal rules in your country about sending postcards.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
