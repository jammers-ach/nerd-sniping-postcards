<p>Nerd sniping was popularised in <a href="http://xkcd.com/356/">xkcd #356</a>. </p>

<p><img src="http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/nerd_sniping.png" alt="xkcd 356"></p>

<p>I saw this, thought about the infinute resitor problem, gave up and read the solution.</p>

<p>I then thought "I have friends, they like postcards, they also like hard problems." so I loaded up inskape and made a card with this problem on it and sent it to my friend.</p>

<p>I also realised I have friends who aren't eletrical engineers, but are computer scientists, they would also <em>love</em> a postcard from me with a difficult problem on it. So why not send it to them?</p>

<p>Thus nerd-sniping-cards was born</p>

<ol>
<li>First think of someone who has done you wrong.</li>
<li>Download and print the files onto some nice 230gsm card. You can either print the PNG files or the SVG files from inkscape.</li>
<li>Turn it over, put on the address and a stamp, and a little message, something like <em>Remember to show your working</em>
</li>
<li>Post it to them</li>
</ol><p>n.b. I'm from Britian and live in Russia. check the postal rules in your country about sending postcards.</p>
